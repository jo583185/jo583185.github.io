  <h2>Description</h2>
  <body>
    <p>This project was designed to create a basic shop GUI for users to enter the items they wished to purchase.<br>
       The program loads a file which contains all itmes available which allows users to add them to a cart if <br>
       they are available. Invalid or unavailable items will not be added to the cart. Once the user clicks <br>
       the checkout button, a recipt document is output detailing what the user bought, how many they bought, and<br>
       the total cost of the transaction.</p>
